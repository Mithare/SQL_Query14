/**
PROBLEM STATEMENT: In the given input table, some of the invoice are missing, write a sql query to identify the missing serial no. 
As an assumption, consider the serial no with the lowest value to be the first generated invoice and the highest serial no value 
to be the last generated invoice.

drop table if exists invoice;

--Solution 1

--Solution 2

from cte
where n < (select max(serial_no) from invoice)
